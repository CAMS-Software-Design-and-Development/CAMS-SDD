A **software development team** is typically composed of several key roles from both technical and business sides, working collaboratively to design, build, test, and deliver software products. Here's a breakdown of the components:

**Technical Side**
1.	**Software Developers/Engineers**
- Frontend Developers: Focus on the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). They work with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, etc.
- Backend Developers: Responsible for server-side logic, databases, and APIs. They typically work with languages like Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc.
- Full-Stack Developers: Handle both frontend and backend development. They can switch between the two parts of the application as needed.
- Mobile Developers: Specialize in developing apps for mobile platforms (Android, iOS) using languages like Kotlin, Swift, or cross-platform frameworks like Flutter, React Native.
2.	**DevOps Engineer**
- Focuses on automating and streamlining the deployment process. They handle infrastructure, continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and monitoring.
3.	**QA/Testers (Quality Assurance)**
- Ensure the software works as intended by performing manual and automated tests. This group includes roles such as Test Engineers, Test Automation Engineers, and QA Analysts.
4.	**UI/UX Designer**
- UI (User Interface) designers create the look and feel of the application, while UX (User Experience) designers focus on user behavior and how the application works for end users. Their goal is to ensure the product is both visually appealing and user-friendly.
5.	**Systems Architect**
- Designs the software's overall structure and oversees the technical direction of the project. They make high-level decisions about the system's design and scalability.
6.	**Database Administrator**
- Manages databases, ensuring they are structured efficiently, secure, and optimized for performance. They play a key role in database design, data migration, and data security.

**Business Side**
1.	**Product Manager**
- The main liaison between the business and development teams. They prioritize features, define product roadmaps, manage timelines, and ensure the product aligns with business goals. They also gather and refine user requirements.
2.	**Business Analyst**
- Works closely with the product manager and stakeholders to gather detailed business requirements. They translate these requirements into technical specifications for the development team.
3.	**Project Manager**
- Manages timelines, resources, and team coordination. They ensure that the project stays on track, within scope, and on budget. They may also handle risk management and reporting to stakeholders.
4.	**Scrum Master (if using Agile)**
- Facilitates Agile ceremonies like daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives. They work to remove blockers for the team and ensure that Agile practices are followed.
5.	**Stakeholders**
- These can include executives, customers, or department heads who have a vested interest in the outcome of the project. They provide input, feedback, and approval for key decisions.
6.	**Marketing and Sales**
- While not directly involved in development, marketing and sales teams help shape product positioning, user personas, and go-to-market strategies. They also assist with customer feedback loops once the product is launched.
7.	**Customer Support**
- Post-launch, customer support teams provide feedback based on user issues and complaints. This feedback loop can help inform future iterations and updates.

**Cross-functional Collaboration**
- *UX/UI Designer + Developers*: Work together to ensure that the design is technically feasible and that the end product offers a great user experience.
- *Product Manager + Developers*: Ensure that the technical implementation aligns with business objectives and user needs.
- *Scrum Master + Developers/Business Side*: Facilitates smooth communication and resolution of challenges between technical and business sides.
  
**Summary of Team Structure**
- **Technical Roles**: Developers (Frontend, Backend, Full-stack), QA, DevOps, UI/UX Designers, Systems Architects.
- **Business Roles**: Product Manager, Business Analyst, Project Manager, Scrum Master, Stakeholders, Marketing & Sales, Customer Support.
This collaborative structure ensures that the software is not only built to technical specifications but also meets the needs of the business and end-users.
